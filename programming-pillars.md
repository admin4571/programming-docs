# Pillars of Programming

* https://12factor.net/
* Testing/QA (Unit tests, Integration tests, Regression tests, Functional tests, Performance tests)
* Code coverage (> 95%). No code should be checked in without accompanying tests.
* Following language best practices ( naming conventions, coding conventions etc. )
* Documentation for code
* Working on clearly defined goals without infinite timelines
* Peer programming
* Code reviews
* Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
* Object oriented programming ( good interfaces and abstractions to design components)
* Mock software to work without any hardware (Docker)
* Collaborating and committing code into the same trunk/branch efficiently
* Designing clean and easy-to-use APIs (Separating out library code and application code)
* Rapid prototyping
* Efficient debugging
