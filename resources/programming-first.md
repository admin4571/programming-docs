# Programming at FIRST

1. Programming will be divided into Autonomous and Software Infrastructure teams
2. Follow Agile methodology. Breaking up the problem into epics and stories and then assigning tickets to students. Roadmaps, epics and project tracking for software will be Software Mentorsâ€™ responsibility. Each story will have points indicating how long it should take.
3. Programming will be done in sprints and there will be virtual stand-ups 2 times a week where students will report what problems/showstoppers they have currently.
4. We will have 6 weekly sprints . We will merge code into master at the end of each sprint. For the course of this bot, Software Mentors will be the gatekeepers of the repo and will be responsible for code review, merging and building of the code.
5. At the end of each sprint, we will have a working, fully testable artifact that holds up to the 12factor principle.
6. Coding in the first 2 sprints will be focused on using WPI libs and coding best practices.
7. All coding in sprints 3-6 will be done during the week. The weekly meeting will only be for going over items for the next week, asking questions about the previous week, code analysis/reviews, other administrative functions and deploying code/ testing.
